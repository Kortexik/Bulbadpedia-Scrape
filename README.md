# Python Web Scraping Script For Pokémon Data Analysis And "Catch Rate" Prediction Models.

## A functional script featuring automated Selenium web driver for obtaining Pokemon attributes from bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net. Whole code contains 3 jupyter notebooks for Pandas data cleaning and Seaborn plots, Keras neural network and Scikit-learn SVM and Random Forest regression models.

### This project was created to feed my passion for Pokémon. I wanted to do something of my own with these creatures, as it took a lot of time from my childhood to play these games. There is much more to add, like a tableau/Power BI dashboard that I'm working on and optimizing the model to produce even better predictions.
